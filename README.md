# java-wahoo
My grandparents love playing this dumb game called Wahoo. It's like crazy eights, but quicker, making it so that it has to be played more. I think the game lacks skill and you are basically left for dead if you get dealt a bad hand; as well as being totally beholden to the idiot on your left. If you hold just one ace with a suit that never gets called, you are just fated to lose.

I made this program to simulate 10,000 games of Wahoo.

My findings show that the winning hand will often be dealt low cards. The hand that will go on to win will ALSO likely NOT be dealt an ace. It's total luck, grandma.

Example run:
Average value of a card in the winning hand: 7.633731245208618
Average amount of suits in the winning hand: 2.7872084109078963
Average aces the winning hand gets dealt: 0.375205344431059

oh yeah this one took foreverðŸ˜Ž
